Made on 06/27/2023 while learning basic web development.

As of the initial creation of this repository and the first working prototype, I have finished through Lesson 12 of [SuperSimpleDev's HTML & CSS Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) and I have finished through lesson 8 of [SuperSimpleDev's Javascript course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww). I recommend both of these courses if you are interested in learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
